## Introduction
The notebook `DASTGYR_CASE_STUDY.ipynb` explores various aspects of Dastgyr's business, providing insights into team selection, order cancellation reasons, and inventory prioritization.

## Team Selection
For the team selection process, the notebook analyzes agent performance based on onboardings/signups and orders placed through referral codes. SQL queries and Python code are utilized to derive meaningful insights into agent performance.

## Order Cancellation Reasons
Understanding the reasons behind order cancellations is crucial for business improvement. The notebook investigates prevalent cancellation reasons and suggests strategies to minimize cancellations. SQL queries and Python code are employed to analyze the provided cancellation reasons data.

## Inventory Prioritization
To address complaints about incomplete orders due to stockouts, the notebook recommends prioritizing specific SKUs in each category for inventory management. The logic behind SKU selection is discussed. Both SQL queries and Python code are used for SKU analysis.

## SQL Queries
The SQL queries section provides queries for extracting relevant insights from the provided data, including team selection, cancellation reasons, and SKU prioritization.

## Python/R Implementation
The Python/R Implementation section demonstrates the use of Python or R programming languages to extract insights from the data. This includes code for analyzing agent performance, identifying cancellation reasons, and prioritizing SKUs.

Feel free to explore the notebook for detailed code implementation and analysis.
